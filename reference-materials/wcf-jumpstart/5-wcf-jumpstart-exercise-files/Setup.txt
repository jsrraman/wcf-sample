To build and run the projects for this module, you will need to follow the database setup instructions in module 2.
To run the code without modification, you will also need to create a local machine user account named "test" with a password of "test". Or just comment out the two lines of code in the client MainWindowViewModel that set ClientCredentials on the proxy.
Then just open the solution in Visual Studio 2013 and run.
